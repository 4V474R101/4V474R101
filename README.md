## 🚀 About Me

🛠️ I build and break systems for a living.
3+ years of hands-on experience in offensive security, focused on Windows & Linux exploitation, red team tradecraft, and custom tooling.

🐍⚙️ My core strengths are Python and Go for offensive tooling, automation, and C2 components.
🧠 Currently going deep into C++ to sharpen low-level exploitation, memory corruption, and Windows internals.

🔥 I actively work on:

🪟🐧 Windows & Linux exploitation (userland + internals)

🎯 Custom C2 agents, loaders, and infrastructure

🛡️ Evasion techniques (EDR/AV-aware design, OPSEC-first tooling)

🧪 Red team tooling and proof-of-concept exploits

🐞 Bug bounty research with an exploitation-first mindset

🔍 I care less about “running tools” and more about how and why things break.
📈 Always learning, always tearing things apart, always improving tradecraft.

🎯 Focus: Windows exploitation · Red Team ops · Low-level research
💻 Languages: Python, Go, C++ (in progress)
